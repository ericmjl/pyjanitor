## Contributing Guidelines
Please try to include a quick summary of where you found the data and what it contains, then have a clearly documented workflow which explains what steps you took to clean the data. Feel free to go further and add a section on analyzing the data however that is optional. The notebooks should be clear and illustrate the benefits gained from using pyjanitor
